**Overview**

You will write a solution validator for a board game similar to Sudoku. 
The game has an n by n board. Each row and column will be filled by 
numbers between 1 and n. Like Sudoku, each number can appear once and only once in each row and each column. 
But unlike Sudoku some adjacent cells have additional constraints between them. 
For example, in the board shown below cell (1, 1) should be greater 
than cell (1, 2), cell (2,3) should be greater than cell (3,3).

1,4,2,3

2,3,1,4

4,2,3,1

3,1,4,2

**Requirements**

You will be writing a program to validate a given solution of the puzzle. 
You need to come up with the data structures to represent the board, 
the constraints and the solution, as well as the algorithm to validate it. 
For example hereâ€™s the pseudo code:
boolean validateSolution(board, solution)
return true 
if the solution is valid, false otherwise

**Testing Steps:**
1) Provide input file in BoardGameValidatorTest class.
   String inputFile = "src/test/resources/input/input_valid_4X4.txt";
   
2) Execute the test case testSolution() to test the board.
